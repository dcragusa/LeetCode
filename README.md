# LeetCode

My solutions to LeetCode problems.

Each file has a problem statement, my solution, and a couple of tests, occasionally with my reasoning on how the 
solution was achieved.

[1.](https://github.com/dcragusa/LeetCode/blob/master/1.py)
**Two Sum** - 
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

[2.](https://github.com/dcragusa/LeetCode/blob/master/2.py)
**Add Two Numbers** - 
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse 
order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

**Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** - 
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

[4.](https://github.com/dcragusa/LeetCode/blob/master/4.py)
**Median of Two Sorted Arrays** - 
There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
