# LeetCode

My solutions to LeetCode problems.

Each file has a problem statement, my solution, and a couple of tests, occasionally with my reasoning on how the 
solution was achieved.

1. **Two Sum** - Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
2. **Add Two Numbers** - You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
3. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** - Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
