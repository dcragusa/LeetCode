# LeetCode

My solutions to LeetCode problems.

Each file has a problem statement, my solution, and a couple of tests, occasionally with my reasoning on how the 
solution was achieved.

[1.](1.py)
**Two Sum** - 
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

[2.](2.py)
**Add Two Numbers** - 
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse 
order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

[3.](3.py)
**Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** - 
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

[4.](4.py)
**Median of Two Sorted Arrays** - 
There are two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays.

[5.](5.py)
**Longest Palindromic Substring** - 
Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic substring in `s`. 
You may assume that the maximum length of `s` is 1000.

[6.](6.py)
**ZigZag Conversion** - 
The string `PAYPALISHIRING` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this:

    P   A   H   N
    A P L S I I G
    Y   I   R

And then read line by line: `PAHNAPLSIIGYIR`

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given the number of rows.

[7.](7.py)
**Reverse Integer** - 
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

[8.](8.py)
**String to Integer** - 
Implement `atoi` which converts a string to an integer. The function first discards as many whitespace characters as 
necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional 
initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have 
no effect on the behavior of this function.

[9.](9.py)
**Palindrome Number** - 
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

[10.](10.py)
**Regular Expression Matching** - 
Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `.` and `*`.

[11.](11.py)
**Container With Most Water** - 
You are given `n` non-negative integers <code>a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub></code>, where each 
represents a point at coordinate <code>(i, a<sub>i</sub>)</code>. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two 
endpoints of line `i` are at <code>(i, a<sub>i</sub>)</code> and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which together with 
the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

[12.](12.py)
**Integer to Roman** - 
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from `1` to `3999`.

[13.](13.py)
**Roman to Integer** - 
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from `1` to `3999`.

[14.](14.py)
**Longest Common Prefix** - 
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
