# LeetCode

My solutions to LeetCode problems.

Each file has a problem statement, my solution, and a couple of tests, occasionally with my reasoning on how the 
solution was achieved.

[1.](1.py)
**Two Sum** - 
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

[2.](2.py)
**Add Two Numbers** - 
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse 
order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

[3.](3.py)
**Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** - 
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

[4.](4.py)
**Median of Two Sorted Arrays** - 
There are two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays.

[5.](5.py)
**Longest Palindromic Substring** - 
Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic substring in `s`. 
You may assume that the maximum length of `s` is 1000.

[6.](6.py)
**ZigZag Conversion** - 
The string `PAYPALISHIRING` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this:

    P   A   H   N
    A P L S I I G
    Y   I   R

And then read line by line: `PAHNAPLSIIGYIR`

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given the number of rows.

[7.](7.py)
**Reverse Integer** - 
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

[8.](8.py)
**String to Integer** - 
Implement `atoi` which converts a string to an integer. The function first discards as many whitespace characters as 
necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional 
initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have 
no effect on the behavior of this function.

[9.](9.py)
**Palindrome Number** - 
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

[10.](10.py)
**Regular Expression Matching** - 
Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `.` and `*`.

[11.](11.py)
**Container With Most Water** - 
You are given `n` non-negative integers <code>a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub></code>, where each 
represents a point at coordinate <code>(i, a<sub>i</sub>)</code>. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two 
endpoints of line `i` are at <code>(i, a<sub>i</sub>)</code> and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which together with 
the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

[12.](12.py)

[13.](13.py)
**Roman to Integer** - 
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from `1` to `3999`.

[16.](16.py)
**3Sum Closest** - 
Given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest 
to target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

[17.](17.py)
**Letter Combinations of a Phone Number** - 
Given a string containing digits from `2-9` inclusive, return all possible letter combinations (those on telephone
buttons) that the number could represent.

[18.](18.py)
**4Sum** - 
Given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `target`, are there elements `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` in `nums` 
such that `a + b + c + d = target`? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

[19.](19.py)
**Remove Nth Node From End of List** - 
Given a linked list, remove the _n_-th node from the end of list and return its head.

division or mod operators. Return the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`.

without any intervening characters.

[31.](31.py)
**Next Permutation** - 
Implement `next_permutation`, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation. If such an 
arrangement is not possible, it must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e. sorted in ascending order). 
The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.

[32.](32.py)
**Longest Valid Parentheses** - 
Given a string containing just the characters `(` and `)`, find the length of the longest valid parentheses substring.

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand, e.g. 
`[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]` might become `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`. You are given a target value to search. 
If found in the array return its index, otherwise return `-1`. You may assume no duplicate exists in the array. 
Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of `O(log n)`.
